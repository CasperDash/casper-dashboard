-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

## Architecture

![Casperdash architecture view](/doc/assets/architecture.png)

### Event Handler

Event handler is a NodeJS program that offers these following features:

-   Listen to the DeployProcessed event from a Casper Node.

-   Parse events and send them to MongoDB

-   [WIP] Retry the Casper Node connection if it drops

### Web Server

Web server is implemented in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It allows us to create read-only data pipeline for clients.

Having multiple Web Servers helps to scale horizontally by serving equally the incoming traffic among instances.

### Client

React web app provides user a simple and convenient dashboard to explore the blocks and manipulate the wallets.
