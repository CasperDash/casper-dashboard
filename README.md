## Development

### Prerequisites

-   yarn >= 1.22.5
-   nodejs = 14

## Architecture

### Web Server

https://github.com/CasperDash/casperdash-api

Web server is implemented in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It allows us to create read-only data pipeline for clients.

### Client

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) + [Flux structure](https://www.javatpoint.com/react-flux-concept#:~:text=Flux%20is%20an%20application%20architecture,a%20library%20nor%20a%20framework.&text=It%20is%20a%20kind%20of,of%20Unidirectional%20Data%20Flow%20model.)

React web app provides user a simple and convenient dashboard to explore the blocks and manipulate the wallets.

There are 2 parts, web and browser extension which are sharing similar logic and dataflow. The main different is user interfaces.

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is using for building each platform.

#### I. Web

##### 1. Install

```sh
cd YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY/casperdash-client/client
yarn install
```

##### 2. UI components

The main UI components of web are placed under

```
YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY/casperdash-client/client/src/components/web
```

##### 3. Configurations

The configuration can be configurated by editing .env.\*.local

```
REACT_APP_API_ROOT=https://localhost:3001  //api endpoint
REACT_APP_NETWORK_NAME=casper-test // casper network
REACT_APP_AUCTION_HASH=93d923e336b20a4c4ca14d592b60e5bd3fe330775618290104f9beb326db7ae2  // contract hash for delegation
REACT_APP_AVAILABLE_FEATURES=["home","dashboard","history","nfts","tokens","keyManager","staking"] //Features can be enabled/disabled
```

##### 4. Usage

```shell
yarn dev             // start web with dev config
yarn start-mainnet  // start web with testnet config
yarn start-testnet // start web with mainnet config
yarn test         // run test with coverage
```

#### II. Browser Extension

##### 1. Install

```sh
cd YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY/casperdash-client/client
yarn install
```

##### 2. UI components

The main UI components of web-extension are placed under

```

##### 3. Configurations

The configuration can be configurated by editing .env.\*.local

```
REACT_APP_API_ROOT=https://localhost:3001  //api endpoint

REACT_APP_AUCTION_HASH=93d923e336b20a4c4ca14d592b60e5bd3fe330775618290104f9beb326db7ae2  // contract hash for delegation
```

##### 4. Usage

```shell
yarn dev-extension              // watch extension with dev config
